# Installation

## Windows (64-bit)

### Requirements
- Windows 10 64-bit or later
- No additional runtimes required — all dependencies are bundled

### Steps

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/2E0LXY/wsjt-y/releases/latest)
2. Download `wsjty-3.0.0-2.0.16-win64.exe`
3. Run the installer — accept the UAC prompt
4. Default install path: `C:\WSJT\wsjtx\`
5. A desktop shortcut and Start Menu entry for **WSJT-Y** are created

### Uninstall

Use **Add or Remove Programs** → search for **WSJT-Y** → Uninstall.

### Upgrading

Run the new installer over the existing installation. Settings in `%APPDATA%\WSJT-X` are preserved.

## Linux (Debian / Ubuntu 22.04+)

### Requirements
- Debian 12 (Bookworm) or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later, amd64
- PulseAudio or ALSA (pipewire with pulseaudio compatibility also works)

### Steps

1. Download `wsjty_3.0.0-2.0.16_amd64.deb` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/2E0LXY/wsjt-y/releases/latest)

2. Install:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i wsjty_3.0.0-2.0.16_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f          # fix any missing dependencies
```

3. Launch from your desktop menu, or from a terminal:
```bash
wsjtx
```

### Upgrading

Install the new `.deb` over the old one — `dpkg` will replace in place. Configuration in `~/.config/WSJT-X 2.x/` is preserved.

### Removing

```bash
sudo dpkg -r wsjty
```

## Post-install: audio and CAT setup

See the **[Getting Started](Getting-Started)** guide for audio device selection, radio CAT configuration and PTT setup.

---

## Verifying the installation

After launch you should see:
- Title bar: **wsjtx  (WSJT-Y by 2E0LXY v2.0.16)**
- **Help → About WSJT-Y** shows the version and GitHub link

If you see an older title bar (e.g. "WSJT-Z MOD by SQ9FVE"), you have an old release installed. Download the latest from the releases page.
